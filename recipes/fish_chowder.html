    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This fish chowder recipe is one of the best chowders I've had; my kids love it too! The fishermen of Bodega Bay, California, shared this favorite, quick, and easy recipe with my sister during a fish festival. We top the chowder with bacon bits and a few shakes of hot sauce for a little spice. Enjoy!</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>

        <li>Butter: This fish chowder recipe starts with two tablespoons of butter.</li> 
        <li>Vegetables: You'll need an onion, mushrooms, celery, and potatoes.</li> 
        <li>Stock: Use store-bought chicken stock or make your own at home.</li> 
        <li>Fish: We love cod for this recipe, but you can use any whitefish you like.</li> 
        <li>Clam juice: Clam juice takes the seafood flavor up a notch.</li> 
        <li>Flour: Thicken the chowder up with all-purpose flour.</li> 
        <li>Seasonings: Season the fish chowder with Old Bay seasoning, salt, and pepper.</li> 
        <li>Evaporated milk: Evaporated milk makes the chowder even thicker and richer.</li> 
        <li>Bacon: Top each bowl of fish chowder with crumbled bacon.</li> 
    </ul>
